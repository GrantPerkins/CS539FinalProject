In this folder, there is `rnn.ipynb`. I have included it, as I spent a long time getting both GRU and LSTM working for this task, including getting my datasets working with the PyTorch data loader.

I was unsuccessful in getting these models to make useful predictions (they only predicted 1 regardless of input), but I did have a lot of fun learning how they work.

I also include old_dataset.py, which includes all of my Tensor manipulation stuff.
